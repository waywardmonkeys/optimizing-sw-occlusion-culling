In January of 2013, some nice folks at Intel released a `Software
Occlusion Culling demo`_ with full source code. I spent about two
weekends playing around with the code, and after realizing that it made
a great example for various things I'd been meaning to write about for a
long time, started churning out blog posts about it for the next few
weeks. This is the resulting series.

Here's the list of posts (the series is now finished):

#. `"Write combining is not your friend"`_, on typical write combining
   issues when writing graphics code.
#. `"A string processing rant"`_, a slightly over-the-top post that
   starts with some bad string processing habits and ends in a rant
   about what a complete minefield the standard C/C++ string processing
   functions and classes are whenever non-ASCII character sets are
   involved.
#. `"Cores don't like to share"`_, on some very common pitfalls when
   running multiple threads that share memory.
#. `"Fixing cache issues, the lazy way"`_. You could redesign your
   system to be more cache-friendly - but when you don't have the time
   or the energy, you could also just do this.
#. `"Frustum culling: turning the crank"`_ - on the other hand, if you
   do have the time and energy, might as well do it properly.
#. `"The barycentric conspiracy"`_ is a lead-in to some in-depth posts
   on the triangle rasterizer that's at the heart of Intel's demo. It's
   also a gripping tale of triangles, MÃ¶bius, and a plot centuries in
   the making.
#. `"Triangle rasterization in practice"`_ - how to build your own
   precise triangle rasterizer and *not* die trying.
#. `"Optimizing the basic rasterizer"`_, because this is real time, not
   amateur hour.
#. `"Depth buffers done quick, part 1"`_ - at last, looking at (and
   optimizing) the depth buffer rasterizer in Intel's example.
#. `"Depth buffers done quick, part 2"`_ - optimizing some more!
#. `"The care and feeding of worker threads, part 1"`_ - this project
   uses multi-threading; time to look into what these threads are
   actually doing.
#. `"The care and feeding of worker threads, part 2"`_ - more on
   scheduling.
#. `"Reshaping dataflows"`_ - using global knowledge to perform local
   code improvements.
#. `"Speculatively speaking"`_ - on store forwarding and speculative
   execution, using the triangle binner as an example.
#. `"Mopping up"`_ - a bunch of things that didn't fit anywhere else.
#. `"The Reckoning"`_ - in which a lesson is learned, but `the damage is
   irreversible`_.

All the code is available on `Github`_; there's various branches
corresponding to various (simultaneous) tracks of development, including
a lot of experiments that didn't pan out. The articles all reference the
`blog branch`_ which contains only the changes I talk about in the posts
- i.e. the stuff I judged to be actually useful.

Special thanks to Doug McNabb and Charu Chandrasekaran at Intel for
publishing the example with full source code and a permissive license,
and for saying "yes" when I asked them whether they were okay with me
writing about my findings in this way!
